T3Protocol

This is a sample code to demonstrate how to 'hack'(capture and modify) T3 protocol based java RMI stream. 
The code discloses T3 protocol stream format. Compared with java standard serialization mechanism, 
T3 protocol only transfers object field data, the class schema information are kept both in local and 
remote side stacks and are transfered only once. So, T3 protocol has higher efficiency than standard RMI
protocol.
